CUBRID Ruby Interface Unit Test
=====================================

1. Overview

This folder contains unit test cases for CUBRID Ruby interface 8.4.4
You could run the codes to test the basic functions introduced on http://ruby-doc.org/gems/docs/c/cubrid-0.65/   


2. Requirements

2.1 Environment Setup
1) Install Ruby 1.8.7 or above
2) Download CUBRID Ruby driver 8.4.4 and install it by using command 'gem install cubrid-8.4.4.gem'
3) Install CUBRID 8.4.4 on either local machine or a remote server  
4) Start CUBRID service and 'demodb' database (demodb is installed by default)

2.2 Testing Tools
1) Ruby Test:Unit Module
2) Shell - used to run all the cases automatically, you could install shell on Linux, or install Linux-like environment (e.g Cywin) if using Windows OS  


3. Run Unit Tests & Read the Test Results

3.1 Run all the tests 
1) You could use shell to test all the cases once, simply type "sh run_test.sh"
2) The test.result file would be then generated which contains all the test results
   you can find the number of tests, assertions, failures and errors for each test class

3.2 Run the single test
1) You could use ruby command to run a single test individually, such as 'ruby -rubygems connection.rb'
2) The test result would be displayed on screen directly, such as: 
   " 
   [ruby@NC-PL-QA-012 unittest]$ ruby -rubygems statement.rb 
   Finished in 0.319454 seconds.
   11 tests, 34 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
   "
